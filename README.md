# Unit-4-Game
CrystalCollector Game 

This crystals game is a JQuery based game. When the user loads the page, it will have a number that the computer has chosen from 19-120. The user will have 4 crystals underneath as buttons to add their own total to match what the computer has guessed. 

Each gem has a different total from 1-12 and is hidden from the user; once the user has won or lost the round the computer will then again choose another random number to reach along with assiging the gems all new numbers as well.

If the game is won or lost it will not reload the page, it will add a total to "Wins and Losses" and reset all other values to both gems and randomly chosen number.
